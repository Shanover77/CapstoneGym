This project is to critique an exercise by using an ensemble of ML/Vision models. Mainly focuses on orientation and angle of joints based on the human pose estimate (33 Joints)

## Key Milestones
1. Repetition detection model
2. Orientation and symmetry model
3. Threshold predictor for training step

## Environment Variables
To run this project, ensure the following environment variable is set in your .env file:
`VIDEO_FILE_NAME=barbell_dead_row_65906101_s05_13ang.mp4`
with the file format of `exerciseName_cameraId_personId_features.`

- exerciseName: barbell_dead_row
- cameraId: 65906101
- personId: s05
- features: 13ang
